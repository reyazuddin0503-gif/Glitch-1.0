# ðŸŒ¿ Fast Fashion Alternative Finder

## Project Overview

This is a simple web app designed to help users find eco-friendly clothing alternatives to fast fashion.  
Users can enter the name of a clothing item (e.g., jeans, jacket, t-shirt), and the app suggests local thrift stores, repair shops, or ethical brands where they can find sustainable options.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€” For the page structure and elements.  
- **CSS3** â€” For styling and responsive design.  
- **JavaScript** â€” To handle user input, filter data, and dynamically display results.

---

## Code Explanation

- The list of eco-friendly alternatives is **hardcoded** inside the JavaScript as an array of objects, each containing:
  - `name` â€” Store or brand name  
  - `type` â€” Category (Thrift Store, Repair Shop, Ethical Brand)  
  - `location` â€” Physical location (optional)  
  - `website` â€” Website URL (optional)  
  - `items` â€” Array of clothing items available at that store

- When the user clicks **Find Alternatives**, the script:
  - Reads the input text.
  - Converts it to lowercase and trims whitespace.
  - Filters the list to find matches for the entered item.
  - Displays results dynamically in the page.
  - Shows a friendly message if no matches are found or if input is empty.

## Future Improvements

- Replace the hardcoded data with a real database or API.
- Add location-based filtering using maps or GPS.
- Allow users to add reviews or ratings for stores.
- Improve UI/UX with better styling and animations.
